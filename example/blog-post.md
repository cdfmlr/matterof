# Getting Started with Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency.

## Why Rust?

Rust provides memory safety without a garbage collector, making it ideal for system-level programming.

## Installation

Install Rust using rustup:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
